## Features
**Enshrouded Safer** is a small tool designed to assist server owners in transferring their previously played game progress to their own server.

It is **kept simple** so that **everyone can handle it**. This process allows players to **secure their progress in Enshrouded** on their own servers and continue from there, which is particularly **useful** if you, for example, are opening your own server with a hosting service and do not want to start from scratch again. You can also **synchronize your progress across multiple servers**.


 

## Functions
This script searches for your memory status and character and creates a safe copy that you can save at a specific location of your choice. You can then upload this data to your server.
